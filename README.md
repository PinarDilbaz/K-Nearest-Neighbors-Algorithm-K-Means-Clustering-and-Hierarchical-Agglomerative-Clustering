# K-Nearest-Neighbors-Algorithm-K-Means-Clustering-and-Hierarchical-Agglomerative-Clustering
--I have used the version of Python 3.9.7 <br /> 
--I have used Microsoft Windows for operating system <br /> 
--There are 6 different python files, 3 of which are for testing the codes and the other three are for the codes of the algorithms. <br /> 
--First, the numpy package needs to be imported, if you don't have it on your computer, you need to install it. <br /> 
--There are also datasets in the hw2 file. <br /> 
--To load the datasets we need the path of the datasets. <br /> 
For example, on my own computer, the path is as follows; C:/Users/ASUS/Desktop/hw2/kmeans/dataset1.npy <br /> 
To run the code on your own computer, you need to replace these paths with paths with your own datasets. <br /> 
--At the same time, it is possible to test the codes using test files. <br /> 
--For KNN, once the distance metric is selected a graph will appear for the 10-fold cv and it may take some time. <br /> 
--For K-means, first, the appropriate k values ​​were found using the elbow method and this code is commented on, <br /> 
because it takes too long, then colored results will be displayed for each dataset with suitable k value. <br /> 
--For HAC, colored clustering results will be displayed for all 4 datasets using 4 criterions separately. <br />
